Light­weight and mod­u­lar C++11/C++14 graph­ics mid­dle­ware for games and da­ta vi­su­al­iza­tion.

Look­ing for an open-source li­brary that gives you graph­ics ab­strac­tion and plat­form in­de­pen­dence on ma­jor desk­top, mo­bile and web plat­forms? Do you want it to have all the con­ve­nience util­i­ties around yet stay small, pow­er­ful and not give up on flex­i­bil­i­ty? Here it is. And it’s free to use, even for com­mer­cial pur­pos­es.

For bugs with the API itself, please file issues with the upstream developer on github: https://github.com/mosra/magnum - note there are separate repositories for magnum, corrade, plugins, etc - please file bugs in the appropriate project.

For bugs with the packages (dependency issues, etc), please file bugs here in Launchpad.
